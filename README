This contains the "raw" R package, which needs to be installed, e.g., like this:

R CMD INSTALL -l ../library Reasoning

The above would be executed from this (Code) directory, and would install the
package for use in the 'library' directory one level up from here.

Mostly you should probably not be mucking with this unless you talk to "someone
in charge" (or if you are "someone in charge"!).
