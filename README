This contains the "raw" R package, which needs to be installed, e.g., like this:

R CMD INSTALL -l ../library Reasoning

The above would be executed from this (Code) directory, and would install the
package for use in the 'library' directory one level up from here. I don't
currently specify a custom direcotry - it just goes in with the system libs
(i.e., no '-l' argument).

Mostly you should probably not be mucking with this unless you talk to "someone
in charge" (or if you are "someone in charge"!).
